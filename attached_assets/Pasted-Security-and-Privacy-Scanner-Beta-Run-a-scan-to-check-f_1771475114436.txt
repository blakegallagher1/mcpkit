Avoid executing dynamically constructed SQL strings as this bypasses SQLAlchemy's SQL injection protections. Dynamic string construction makes the query vulnerable when user input is involved. Use `execute(text("... :param_name"), param_name=value)` with named parameters instead of f-strings/concatenation to ensure proper escaping.
Security
Found dynamic content used in a system call. This is dangerous if external data can reach this function call because it allows a malicious actor to execute commands. Use the 'subprocess' module instead, which is easier to use without accidentally exposing a command injection vulnerability.

A gitleaks Openai API Key detected. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in connection strings as this creates security risks. Instead, use environment variables to store and access credentials at runtime. If you need the actual credential values to make this work properly, ask me to provide them through Replit's secret system.
Security
Detected calls to child_process from a function argument `cmd`. This could lead to a command injection if the input is user controllable. Try to avoid calls to child_process, and if it is needed ensure user input is correctly sanitized or sandboxed.
Security
Found '$SPAWN' with '{shell: true}'. This is dangerous because this call will spawn the command using a shell process. Doing so propagates current shell settings and variables, which makes it much easier for a malicious actor to execute commands. Use '{shell: false}' instead.

XSS Vulnerability: Unsafe DOM Manipulation. User controlled data in methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or `document.write` is an anti-pattern that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Replace with safe DOM methods: Use createElement() + appendChild() + textContent for dynamic content. Avoid use innerHTML with user data: Even escaped data can be risky. If HTML injection is absolutely necessary: Sanitize with DOMPurify library first.

Security
Detected subprocess function 'Popen' without a static string. If this data can be controlled by a malicious actor, it may be an instance of command injection. Audit the use of this call to ensure it is not controllable by an external resource. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.
Security
Found dynamic content when spawning a process. This is dangerous if external data can reach this function call because it allows a malicious actor to execute commands. Ensure no external data reaches here.
Security
Detected user input entering a `subprocess` call unsafely. This could result in a command injection vulnerability. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the host, which allows them to download malware, scan sensitive data, or run any command they wish on the server. Do not let users choose the command to run. In general, prefer to use Python API versions of system commands. If you must use subprocess, use a dictionary to allowlist a set of commands.
Security
Detected subprocess function 'run' without a static string. If this data can be controlled by a malicious actor, it may be an instance of command injection. Audit the use of this call to ensure it is not controllable by an external resource. You may consider using 'shlex.escape()'.
